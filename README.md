# FitThinDisk
`FitThinDisk` is a Python program to fit the spectral line cubes with a geometrically thin disk model. By giving the spectral line cubes in FITS format, it minimizes the value of &chi;<sup>2</sup> between model and data, and generate the model cube in FITS format.  

## Model Parameters
`qr`, power-law index of the rotation velocity as a function of radius, `vr(r/r0)^qr`, r0 is an arbitrary reference radius and vr is the rotation velocity at the reference radius 
`qd`,
